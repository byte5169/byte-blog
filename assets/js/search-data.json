            "content": "Hello stranger, . This is a blog from a person who his whole life (around 25 years) was studying humanitarian sciences and now decided to drastically change his field of work. . The main goal of this blog is to follow my journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. . A bit of myself: . I&#39;m 31 as of 10.01.2021. . I do know 3 foreign languages (English, Swedish, Chinese), that is not including my two native languages. I have been working for a large IT company for the past 10 years on various positions. A month ago I had a chance to switch drastically my field of work from PM and PdM to more AI and ML field. . So as you may guess I have accepted this challenge and began to study ML from scratch I would say. I had some experience on coding before, but it was so long ago so basically I had to start all over again. . For the past month I have been learning various number of course from codeacademy, udemy, youtube, khanacademy, etc to gain a bit of basic coding knowledge and math at least. . Enough about me, some more on the blog topics. . About blog . This blog will contain all different kind of materials on ML, DL, math and everything that I will come across during my voyage. . To catch you up . The best resources I will be using here: . Python | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Scikit-learn | Fastai | AWS | Most of the things above I still haven&#39;t touched yet, and I will learn it and post my little experiments here. . Internet resourse: . Khanacademy for any learning math problems. | Kaggle best website if you want to look for datasets. | ML learning tree I have came across this one on the first week of learning and it blowed my mind. It was created by a great youtube person Daniel Bourke | I will try to post every week, summing up what have I learned, maybe with some fancy project based on the learnings. . PS. I&#39;m new to fastpages and github in general, so bear with me and my writings it will improve with time, I promise. .",
